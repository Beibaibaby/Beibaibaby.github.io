    <p>Email:<br>yxu103@u.rochester.edu/18300130005@fudan.edu.cn/scixu@ucdavis.edu <br> Students can generally expect a response within 24 hours on weekdays. And please be noticed that Discord is a recommended (by NMA) tool for Communication, I guess that we need few days to see whether it works for us.</p> 
    <p>Office Hours: TBD (But it should be some time in the night since we will share the daytime in the pod.</p> 
    <p>Grading: <br> There is no gpa grading in this course, but you will get a certificate at the end of the course. To get the complete certificate, you are required to participate in the tutorials, peer coding and the project. You are permitted to have at most 2 days of absence if you tell me (also your teammates) in advance.<br> If you have some emergency, please tell me ASAP so that we can figure out the alternative arrangements for participation. </p> 
    <p>Zoom Etiquette: <br> Both Zoom in the Pod and Office hours will not be recorded. You are expected to show mature and respectful behavior both in discussions and in office hours. Do not hesitate to add your preferred name and pronouns in your Zoom name.</p>
