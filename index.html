    <p>Hello, welcome to the course website of NMA2021-DL-POD gainful inchworms</p>
    <p>Instructor Information:</p>
    <p><br>Name: Yunlong (Draco) Xu (he/him/his)<br>This website is built for the students in POD-XXX, and you can find more about myself from my personal homepage.<li><a href="https://yun-long-xu.com">My Homepage </a></li></p>    
    <p>Contact:</p>
    <p>Email:<br>yxu103@u.rochester.edu/18300130005@fudan.edu.cn/scixu@ucdavis.edu <br> Students can generally expect a response within 24 hours on weekdays. And please be noticed that Discord is a recommended (by NMA) tool for Communication, I guess that we need few days to see whether it works for us.</p> 
    <p>Office Hours:</p>
    <p>TBD (But it should be some time in the night since we will share the daytime in the pod.</p>

      <p>Logistics:</p>
      <p>TBD</p>
      <p>Project:</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/projects/docs/project_guidance.md">Project Guidance</a></li>
    <p>Grading:</p> 
    <p>There is no GPA grading in this course, but you will get a certificate at the end of the course. To get the complete certificate, you are required to participate in the tutorials, peer coding and the project. You are permitted to have at most 2 days of absence if you tell me (also your teammates) in advance.<br> If you have some emergency, please tell me ASAP so that we can figure out the alternative arrangements for participation. </p> 
    <p>Prerequisite:</p>
    <p>1. Familiarize yourself with python: It is absolutely ok if you don’t have pervious coding experience. If so, what you may want to do is to learn some python basics. NMA should provide you some resources for it. If you have coded with C or some other programming language, you may also want to do the same thing in advance. If you are proficient in python, sure thing. As for Pytorch (it is a python package helping you do DL with python), don’t worry about it, we will learn it on Week 1 Day 1. <br> 2. Network Connection: Test the network connection. We would use Google products (Colab, Drive...), Github,  TBD</p>

    <p>Zoom Etiquette:</p> 
    <p>Both Zoom in the Pod and Office hours may be recorded. You are expected to show mature and respectful behavior both in discussions and in office hours. Do not hesitate to add your preferred name and pronouns in your Zoom name.</p>
    <p>Academic Honesty Policy:</p>
    <p>As for the project, we do not care how great your work is, and what we care is How Great Your Progress is. You are not expected to publish a NIPS or COLT during the 3-week summer school, and it is acceptable that you didn’t have any positive result on your projects(Your failure is valuable as well). Hence, please make sure your work are on your own contribution.
    <br> And one thing to be noticed, please don’t hang the zoom on and leave for other things. I attended NMA last year and I know some people are doing so. Please don’t do it, and if you have something else to do, just tell me (and your teammates) and leave the zoom room.</p>
      <p>GPU Support:</p>
      <p>There would be no gpu resources provided by NMA, which may not be the case you expect. If you don’t have your own equiped GPU, It is suggested by NMA that you could use Colab (Free Track) or Kaggle. Feel free to contact me if you meet problems on it. As you may or may not know, Colab and Kaggle are pretty good platform, or at least good enough for our course. Therefore, dealing with large model, for instance GPT-3, is not a good idea in your project. It is better for you to do some easier and (no less interesting) hand-on projects. Of course, if you are already an expert, since I know that some of you may be a Phd student, please feel free to do anything you want on your own device.</p>
      <p> Motivation: </p>
      <p> Motivation is the most important thing throughout our journey, at least in NMA2021-DL. Ask yourself about your motivation. Why are you here? What do you want to get? You could talk it with me if you want.<br>
      I was a student in NMA2020 last year. I asked myself many times the same question. If you feel upset or uncomfortable with anything, free free to talk with me. If you feel pushed, talk with me.
          <br> Remember, the only reason I am here is to help you go through these three weeks. I am not Yann LeCun or Geoffrey Hinton. If I were, I would say:"Ok, just listen to me and let us change the world right now. Or at least you would be admitted by MIT or offered by Google with my reference letter." Unfortunately, I am not. Probably (Highly), I know less than you do. My motivation is to give back to the community. And what I want is that you feel okay during the 3 weeks. So, good luck.</p>
