    <p>Hello, welcome to the course website of NMA2021-DL-PODXXX</p>
    <p>Instructor Information:</p>
    <p><br>Name: Yunlong (Draco) Xu (he/him/his)<br>This website is built for the students in POD-XXX, and you can find more about myself from my personal homepage.<li><a href="https://yun-long-xu.com">My Homepage </a></li></p>    
    <p>Contact:</p>
    <p>Email:<br>yxu103@u.rochester.edu/18300130005@fudan.edu.cn/scixu@ucdavis.edu <br> Students can generally expect a response within 24 hours on weekdays. And please be noticed that Discord is a recommended (by NMA) tool for Communication, I guess that we need few days to see whether it works for us.</p> 
    <p>Office Hours:</p>
    <p>TBD (But it should be some time in the night since we will share the daytime in the pod.</p> 
    <p>Grading:</p> 
    <p>There is no gpa grading in this course, but you will get a certificate at the end of the course. To get the complete certificate, you are required to participate in the tutorials, peer coding and the project. You are permitted to have at most 2 days of absence if you tell me (also your teammates) in advance.<br> If you have some emergency, please tell me ASAP so that we can figure out the alternative arrangements for participation. </p> 
    <p>Zoom Etiquette:</p> 
    <p>Both Zoom in the Pod and Office hours may be recorded. You are expected to show mature and respectful behavior both in discussions and in office hours. Do not hesitate to add your preferred name and pronouns in your Zoom name.</p>
    <p>Academic Honesty Policy:</p>
    <p>As for the project, we do not care how great your work is, and what we care is How Great Your Progress is. You are not expected to publish a NIPS or COLT during the 3-week summer school, and it is acceptable that you didn’t have any positive result on your projects(Your failure is valuable as well). Hence, please make sure your work are on your own contribution.
        <br> And one thing to be noticed, please don’t hang the zoom on and leave for other things. I attend NMA last year and I know some people are doing so. Please don’t do it, and if you have something else to do, just tell me (and your teammates) and leave the zoom room.</p>
